## Blake generator

This utility generates fuzzed blake `f` compression function statetests. 

Once it's possible to run statetests on `Istanbul` with `parity-evm`, I can run the 
two side by side. For other clients, they can run this generator to produce 
statetests instead. 

I've pushed a zip-file with 10k generated cases.
